## Textbooks

The main textbook for the unit is:

- Kohnfelder, L,
  [*Designing Secure Software*][kohnfelder] (No Starch Press, 2021)

[kohnfelder]: https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Secure-Software-Guide-Developers/dp/1718501927

As noted on the [welcome page](/#assumed-knowledge), it's assumed you
are already familiar with a procedural or OO language.
It's also advisable to have completed [CITS2002 Systems
Programming][cits2002], which covers operating systems
and C programming, as well as the basics of using the Linux
command-line.

[cits2002]: https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/

If you are after textbooks which cover the recommended prior
knowledge, the following sections give some suggestions.

### The Linux command line

The content of this unit assumes you understand how to
navigate a Unix-like operating system using the command-line,
perform basic file operations, and build C projects using
[`gcc`][gcc] and [GNU Make][make].

[gcc]: https://gcc.gnu.org
[make]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/

(If you've not used the command-line interface of a Unix-like operating system
much, you should get familiar with it. Besides being useful for this unit,
often in industry when working with cloud VMs, the command-line is the
only way you have of accessing them.)

One good tutorial on the Linux command-line is

- <https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/>

and there's also a free PDF guide to using the Linux command line: [*The Linux
Command Line*][lincomm], by William Shotts.

[lincomm]: http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php

The recommended editor for this unit is [`vim`](https://www.vim.org),
though if you are already familiar with Emacs you are welcome to use
that instead. You will not always be able to use a GUI editor such
as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) â€“ the
configuration details we give for some debuggers and static analysers
work only with `vim`.

### C programming { #c-programming }

The content of this unit assumes you already have a basic working knowledge of
the C programming language.
You will need to have access to a good C textbook in order to do well in this
unit. YouTube videos or online tutorials will not be sufficient.

The following is an acceptable C textbook which covers the C11 standard.
(It actually uses the C17 standard, but the differences for our purposes
are minimal.)

- Robert C. Seacord, *[Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C
  Programming](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C)* (No Starch Press,
  2020)

If you are already familiar with the C99 standard, the [Wikipedia page][wiki-c11]
on the C11 standard provides a good summary of the changes. Two of the
most useful features introduced in C11 (for our purposes) are

**[static assertions][static-assert]**{ class="hi-pri" }:

:   these are an improvement on
    preprocessor-based assertions using `#if` and `#error`, because they can
    make use of information known only by the compiler (as opposed to [the
    preprocessor][cpp-assert]) such as the result of `sizeof` and `alignof`
    expressions.\
    &nbsp;

**the [atomic operations library][atomics]**{ class="hi-pri" }:

:   This allows some [race conditions][race-cond] to be avoided.\
    &nbsp;


[wiki-c11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)
[static-assert]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)#Static_assertions
[cpp-assert]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4079243/how-can-i-use-sizeof-in-a-preprocessor-macro
[atomics]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic
[race-cond]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition

### Operating systems

The content of this unit assumes you already have a basic working knowledge of
operating system fundamentals.
It is recommended you have access to a good operating systems textbook in order
to do well in this unit.

The following are acceptable operating systems textbooks:

- Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau, Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, and Peter Reiher,
  *[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)*
  (Arpaci-Dusseau Books, August 2018, Version 1.00)
- Ian Wienand, *[Computer Science from the Bottom Up](https://bottomupcs.com/index.html)*
- Randal Bryant and David O'Hallaron, *[Computer Systems: A Programmer's
  Perspective][cs-prog-persp]* (3rd edn; Pearson, 2015)

[cs-prog-persp]: https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd-dp-013409266X/dp/013409266X

### Attending labs online

If you are enrolled in {{ siteinfo.unitcode }} online,
you can attend your lab/workshop by going to the
