It's recommended you complete this lab in pairs, if possible, and
discuss your results with your partner.

## 1. String-handling functions

On [Moodle](https://quiz.jinhong.org), under the section "Week 4 â€“ string handling", is a
set of exercises on using C's string handling functions
to write a safe "path-construction" function.

Complete the exercises, using your development environment to
help test your code.

Once you have completed the Moodle exercises: if you have time during
the lab, continue with the following sections of this lab worksheet.  If
not, you can work through the remaining sections in your own time.



<div class="solutions">

**Sample solutions**

The following is a sample solution for the `would_wrap_around()`
function:

``` {.C .numberLines}
/** Return true when the sum of dirlen, filelen, extlen and 3
 * would exceed the maximum possible value of a size_t; otherwise,
 * return false.
 */
bool would_wrap_around(size_t dirlen, size_t filelen, size_t extlen) {
  size_t res = dirlen;
  res += filelen;
  if (res < dirlen || res < filelen)
    return true;
  size_t old_res = res;
  res += extlen;
  if (res < old_res || res < extlen)
    return true;
  old_res = res;
  res += 3;
  if (res < old_res || res < extlen)
    return true;
  return false;
}
```



The following is a sample solution for the `make_pathname()`
function:

``` {.C .numberLines}
char* make_pathname(const char *dir, const char *fname, const char *ext) {
  size_t dirlen = strlen(dir);
  size_t filelen = strlen(fname);
  size_t extlen = strlen(ext);

  if (would_wrap_around(dirlen, filelen, extlen)
    return NULL;

  // include terminating NUL
  size_t pathbuf_size = dirlen + filelen + extlen + 3;

  char *path = malloc (pathbuf_size);
  if (!path)
      return NULL;

  memcpy (path, dir, dirlen);
  path[dirlen] = '/';

  memcpy (path + dirlen + 1, fname, filelen);
  path[dirlen + filelen + 1] = '.';

  memcpy(path + dirlen + filelen + 2, ext, extlen + 1);

  return path;
}
```

Some comments on the code:

- When working on a C project, it can be helpful if your
  development team has a convention for distinguishing
  *lengths of strings* (which don't include in their count the
  terminating `NUL`) from *sizes of buffers* (which always *should*
  include in their count any required `NUL` characters).

  This can help make code reviews easier, and ensure mistakes
  aren't made by using one sort of length where the other would
  be appropriate. (Even better would be to configure your team's
  static analysis programs to distinguish the two, and enforce
  rules about how each is used.)

  The code above uses names like `dirlen`, `filelen` etc for string
  lengths, but `pathbuf_size` for a buffer.

We could write a `main` routine which allows us to
invoke `make_pathname` from the command-line, as follows:

```{ .c .numberLines }
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  // skip program name
  argc--;
  argv++;

  if (argc != 3) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Expected 3 args\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  // See note: poor validation!
  char* dir = argv[0];
  char* fname = argv[1];
  char* ext = argv[2];

  char* path = make_pathname(dir, fname, ext);

  if (path != NULL) {
    printf("path is: '%s'\n", path);
    free(path);
  }
  else
    printf("couldn't allocate enough memory\n");

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Some comments on the code:

- In lines 12--14, our program is taking input from a potentially untrusted
  user via the elements of the argv array.

  We can be sure that those elements *are* valid null-terminated strings --
  they aren't `NULL` pointers, nor do they run off past the end of the
  memory segment -- because the language standard assures us so.

  But we *can't* be sure they satisfy the
  other preconditions of `make_pathname` (e.g. the file and extension not
  containing slashes or dots).

  So that will mean that when we call `make_pathname`, we could be violating
  its preconditions, and the returned string might not be what we
  expect and might not be safe to use.

  Furthermore, if we pass that string on to other functions, we can render
  ourselves vulnerable to a *path traversal* attack (see
  <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal>).

  For instance, suppose the `dir` argument is known to be a
  (system-controlled, trusted) path to a directory where web pages are
  stored ("`/path/to/webdir`", say), and the `fname` and `ext` arguments
  are taken from an (untrusted) browser request and specify an HTML file
  to serve up.

  If we haven't validated the contents of the `fname` and `ext`
  arguments, an attacker could set them to `"."` and `"/"`,
  respectively.  Then the result of `make_pathname` would be
  "`/path/to/webdir/../`", which represents the *parent* directory of
  `webdir`.

  We have thus potentially given the attacker the ability to read files
  from outside the directory they should have access to, which could
  include configuration files and other sensitive data.

  We will look in more detail at input validation and path traversal
  attacks in future labs.

An alternative implementation of `make_pathname`:

```{.c .numberLines }
char* make_pathname(const char* dir, const char* fname, const char* ext) {
  if (would_wrap_around(dirlen, filelen, extlen)
    return NULL;

  size_t totalLength = strlen(dir) + strlen(fname) + strlen(ext) + 3;
  // +3 for '/', '.', and '\0'

  char* result = malloc(totalLength);
  if (result == NULL)
    return NULL;

  int written = snprintf(result, totalLength, "%s/%s.%s", dir, fname, ext);
  if (written != totalLength - 1) {
    free(result);
    return NULL; // error occurred
  }

  return result;
}
```

Comments on this implementation:

- This implementation uses `snprintf` -- many C programmers would regard
  `memcpy` and array-element assignment as the simpler solution, though,
  because when called correctly, `memcpy` *can't* fail.
  (`memcpy` is basically just a `for` loop which copies from destination
  to source.)

  `snprintf` on the other hand is a complicated function. There's no
  obvious reason why it *should* fail, if our logic is correct; but
  nevertheless, we can only be certain that it worked if the number of
  bytes written was exactly equal to what we expected (`totalLength -
  1`). So we've added in an additional possibility for failure that wasn't
  in the original specification -- the spec said we would *only* return
  `NULL` if it wasn't possible to allocate enough memory, but now we're
  opening up the possibility for other causes of error.

  (Technically, if we're failing for some reason other than "can't
  allocate enough memory", we should probably `abort()` rather than
  return `NULL`, because we can't fulfil the promise we made in the
  function specification.)

## 2. `setuid` and Unix permissions

This section and the following ones introduce the Unix
access control system. This includes:

- traditional Unix file access mechanisms;
- `setuid` permissions; and
- Linux capabilities.

(You may want to refer back to this lab worksheet in future labs,
when we look at how `setuid` programs can be exploited.)

`setuid` ("set user identity") is an important security mechanism on
Unix operating systems.
When a `setuid` program is run, it assumes the privileges of the
*owner of the executable file* (for instance, `root`), rather than (as
is usually the case) the privileges of the user executing the command.

An example of a *non*-`setuid` program is `less` (and most other
programs you commonly run). Try running the following commands:

```
$ ls -al /etc/sudoers
$ less /etc/sudoers
```

The output of the `ls` command should look something like this:

```
-r--r----- 1 root root 798 Mar 16 15:22 /etc/sudoers
```

<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">

**Output of `ls`**

![](images/unix_permissions.svg){ width=100% }

The `man ls` documentation unfortunately doesn't fully explain this
listing format -- see the documentation of the [GNU coreutils
package][coreutils] for a fuller explanation, or
[this guide][privs] for a short tutorial.

In brief: the first group of 10 characters (starting with "`-r`")
indicates who can access the file, and how they can access it. Every
file on a Unix-like system has associated with it a set of *flags*
(binary options), and the last 9 characters in that group show what they
are. The meaning of the characters is:

[coreutils]: https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/What-information-is-listed.html

- The first character isn't a flag -- it indicates the type of file.
  A directory is shown as "`d`", and a symbolic link as "l". Other file
  types are shown using other characters, as outlined in the GNU
  coreutils documentation.

- The remaining 9 characters should be read in groups of three.
  The first group indicates permissions available to the file owner,
  the second, permissions available to the file group, and the third,
  permissions available to everyone else.

  If someone has read, write and execute permissions, the group of three
  will be the characters "`rwx`"'; if they only have a subset of those
  permissions, some of the characters will be replaced by a hyphen.

  Thus, a file where the user has read, write and execute permissions,
  but everyone else only has read permissions, will look like this:
  `-rwxr--r--`.

  For some programs, the "`x`" in the first group may be replaced by
  "`s`", as we shall see -- this tells the operating system
  that it has the "`setuid`" feature enabled, and when run, its
  effective permissions are those of the *owner* of the file (rather
  than of the user who started the process).


</div>


The `/etc/sudoers` file specifies which users on the system can
temporarily acquire `root` privileges using the `sudo` command.
Only the `root` user can read the file, so when you try to read it
with `less`, you get a permission error.

[privs]: https://devconnected.com/linux-file-permissions-complete-guide/

Obviously, programs that use features
like `setuid` can be very dangerous: if they are
not carefully written, their elevated privileges can have unexpected
consequences.
However, many programs *do* need to run with special permissions.
Consider the `passwd` program, for instance, which allows a user to
change their password. Passwords on Unix systems
are typically stored in a file called `/etc/shadow`, which only the
`root` user can read or change. (Run `ls -al /etc/shadow` to
see its permissions -- what are they?)
When you successfully run the `passwd` program, it updates the
contents of `/etc/shadow` with your new password (actually, a
[hashed and salted][shadow-file] version of your password), despite the
fact that the user doesn't have permissions to change that file.
Run

[shadow-file]: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcshadow-file/


```
$ ls -al `which passwd`
```

to see the permissions of the `passwd` executable. You should see
something like this:

```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 68208 Mar 14 16:26 /usr/bin/passwd
```

The "`s`" in the first 3 characters of the permissions indicates
that this program has the `setuid` feature enabled.


### 2.1. `setuid` programs

Consider the following commands:

- `"chsh"`
- `"su"`
- `"sudo"`

What do they do? (Read the `man` pages for the commands for details.)
How can you find out where the executable files for those commands are
located? (Hint: check out `man which`.)
List the permissions for the executables using `ls -al`. What do they
have in common? Why is it needed?



<div class="solutions">

**Sample solutions**

The commands all have their `setuid` bit set. This is needed
because:

- For `chsh`, it changes a user's login shell, and that
  information is stored in `/etc/passwd`, which is only
  writeable by root.
  (In other words -- the reason is much the same as for `passwd`.)

or,

- For `su` and `sudo`: they allow commands to be run with `root` permissions.


</div>



For each of these commands, copy the executable to your working
directory, and run `ls -al` on the copy. What permissions does the copy
have? Try running the copied `sudo` and `chsh` commands (give `chsh`
the password `vagrant`, and suggest `/bin/sh` as a new shell). What
happens?

You can add the `setuid` feature to the copied programs by running the command
`chmod u+s ./SOME_PROGRAM` (inserting the name of the copied program
as appropriate). However, the programs will still be owned by you --
what happens if you try to run them?



<div class="solutions">

**Sample solutions**

If you copy one of the `setuid` programs, the copy no
longer has the `setuid` feature. Due to the way they
have been coded, none of the programs will
function properly without both (a) having the `setuid`
bit set, and (b) being owned by `root`.

This is a safety precaution built into the programs:
if the programs detect they
are being used in a way that isn't intended, they
abort execution.

</div>




### 2.2 Principle of least privilege


When a program needs to have the
`setuid` feature enabled, it is best practice to use the lowest
possible level of elevated privilege,
and to use the elevated
privilege level for as short a time as possible.
Once the privileges have been used for whatever purpose they
were needed for, the program should relinquish them --
it does so by calling the `setuid()` function.
(You can read about the `setuid()` function at `man 2 setuid` --
but its use is complicated, and we will elaborate more
on it in the next section.)

Relinquishing privileges is
especially important for long-running processes.
For instance, a web server might require higher permissions
than normal early in the life of the process
(e.g. to read configuration files, or listen for connections on port 80,
which normally only `root` can do)
but should drop
those permissions once they are no longer needed -- otherwise the
potential exists for them to be exploited.

Using as few privileges as are needed, for as short a time as is needed,
is known as the "Principle of Least Privilege": read
more about it in the *Unix Secure Programming HOWTO*
on [minimizing privileges][secure-howto].

[secure-howto]: https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/3.012/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/minimize-privileges.html

**Question:**

:   Suppose we are creating a set of programs
    which manipulate a human resources database. The database
    file is located at `/var/hr/hr.db` and is owned by root.
    One of our programs is called `hr_db_amend`, and is a setuid
    program also owned by root.

    Is this in line with good security practice, as explained in the
    *Unix Secure Programming HOWTO*? If not, what should we do instead?



<div class="solutions">

**Sample solution**

This is not in line with best practice.

Our `hr_db_amend` program will run as `root`, when it could
be given far fewer privileges, which would lessen the impact
if we happen to make a mistake when coding it.

A better approach would be to create a user called `hr`, and
have that user ID own the database file `/var/hr/hr.db` and
the `hr_db_amend` executable.

We could still make our program setuid; but now it would run
as user `hr`, giving it access to the HR database, but not to
important system configuration files like `/etc/passwd` and
`/etc/shadow`.

</div>



### 2.3 Effective versus real user ID

Unix systems keep track of two facts about a running process --
the process's "real user ID" (that is, the user ID of the user
who created the process), and its "effective user ID"
(which represents the permissions the process is currently
acting with, and might be different to the real user ID).

For most programs, the two are exactly the same.
For setuid programs, however, the operating system sets the real user ID
(abbreviated "rUID") as per usual, but sets the effective user ID
(abbreviated "eUID") to the owner of the executable file being run.

The Linux C functions [`getuid` and `geteuid`][getuid-man] are used to
determine at runtime what the rUID and eUID are. This is how a program
like `su` can tell whether it is being run as a setuid, root-owned
program -- it's eUID should be 0.
(Linux also has something called a ["saved user ID"][saved-uid], used for the
situation where a program *mostly* needs to run as root, but temporarily
needs to run some actions as a non-privileged user. However, we will
leave discussion of it until a later lab.)

[getuid-man]: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man2/getuid.2.html
[saved-uid]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier#Saved_user_ID

**Exercise**

:   Compile the following program:

    ```{ .C .numberLines }
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main() {
      uid_t ruid = getuid();
      uid_t euid = geteuid();
      printf("real uid is: %d\n", ruid);
      printf("effective uid is: %d\n", euid);

      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
    ```

    Compare the results it gives when run with the results it gives
    after you change its owner to root and make it a setuid program.



### 2.4 Relinquishing privileges

So, we know that we should use elevated privileges for
as short a time as possible, and then relinquish them.
How do we do that?

The Linux C function [`seteuid`][man-seteuid] lets us
change our eUID; to drop privileges, we just change our
eUID so that it's the same as our rUID.

[man-seteuid]: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man2/seteuid.2.html

However, there are some pitfalls to be aware of when
relinquishing privileges: read the
Software Engineering Institute's [web page on relinquishing
permissions][permission-relinq] for an explanation of
some of the issues.

[permission-relinq]: https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/POS37-C.+Ensure+that+privilege+relinquishment+is+successful

**Question:**

:   In our `hr_db_amend` program described above,
    we initially run with elevated privileges.

    Most users on the system cannot read or write the
    `/var/hr/hr.db` file, but because we are running
    as the `hr` user, we can.

    Our `hr_db_amend` program contains the following code,
    executed shortly after the program has started running:


    ```{ .c .numberLines}
      // open DB file for reading and writing
      fd = open("/var/hr/hr.db", O_RDWR);
      if (fd == -1) {
         printf("Cannot open /var/hr/hr.db\n");
         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
      }

      // now that we have a file descriptor,
      // privileges are no longer needed - relinquish them

      setuid(getuid());  // getuid() returns the real uid
    ```

    Does this code contain potential security flaws?
    If so, how could it be changed to remove them?



<div class="solutions">

**Sample solution**

It does contain security flaws. The `setuid` function (or
`seteuid`, a variant of it found on many Unix-like operating
systems) can fail, and if it fails, then we *haven't successfully
relinquished privileges*. In case of a failure, we must immediately
abort execution -- otherwise, we'll be performing actions which
where intended to be performed by a non-privileged user, but
will be performing them as root. This is highly prone to being
exploited by attackers.

We should check the return value from `setuid`, and if it is
non-zero, we should abort.

(In fact, we should [*always* check the return value from any
function call that can fail][check-ret]. All our subsequent code has presumably been written
on the assumption that the function call succeeded; if it
didn't, then our assumption is wrong, and we have no idea
what the actual current state of the system is.)

[check-ret]: https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/EXP12-C.+Do+not+ignore+values+returned+by+functions


</div>





We will experiment further with `setuid` programs, and
code for using and relinquishing privileges, in future labs.

## 3. Challenge question

(Challenge questions in the lab worksheets are aimed at students
who already have a good knowledge of C and operating systems --
they are not compulsory to complete.)

On Linux, is it possible to write a setuid program in Python? Why
or why not? Is it advisable?




<div class="solutions">

**Sample solution**

In current versions of Linux (since at least kernel version 3.0), it's
not (straightforwardly) possible for a Python program to be setuid.
You can try it by writing the following Python program, and making it
owned by root, executable, and with its setuid bit enabled:


```{ .python .numberLines }
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

euid = os.geteuid()
print("euid is:", euid)
```

When run, this script will simply print out your normal user ID, not 0.

Why is this? One reason is that the file is a script, and isn't being
*executed* in the same way as a binary executable. When asked to execute
a program, the kernel inspects the start of a file to determine
what *sort* of program it is being asked to run.[^search-binary]

[^search-binary]: This is done by the function
  [`search_binary_handler`][search-binary-handler-src] in the kernel.
  You can find more discussion of the process [here][howprog],
  [here][shebangs], [here][execve-gitbook] and [here][modprobe-path].

[search-binary-handler-src]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/a785fd28d31f76d50004712b6e0b409d5a8239d8/fs/exec.c#L1716
[howprog]: https://lwn.net/Articles/630727/
[execve-gitbook]: https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/SysCall/linux-syscall-4.html#execve-system-call
[modprobe-path]: https://github.com/smallkirby/kernelpwn/blob/master/technique/modprobe_path.md#determine-binary-format
[shebangs]: https://deardevices.com/2018/03/04/linux-shebang-insights/

The first 4 bytes of a binary executable on Linux will be `"\0x7fELF"`,
indicating that it's an [ELF-format executable][wiki-elf], but scripts
will start with the characters `"#!"`, indicating that they are intended
to be supplied to an *interpreter* to be run -- in the case of Python scripts,
the interpreter will end up being `/usr/bin/python3`.

[wiki-elf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format

So for Python scripts, the machine-code instructions which are loaded into
memory and executed by the processor don't come from the script
(they couldn't -- the script contains plain text, not machine
code),
but from the Python interpreter binary executable at `/usr/bin/python3`.
That file doesn't have
its setuid bit enabled, so it doesn't run as root. (The script file
is just a data file which the Python interpreter opens, reads, and
interprets as Python instructions.)

You could deliberately *set* the Python interpreter to be a setuid
program, if you wanted; but that would be very unwise, as now all Python
programs would run as root.

Is there any other way one could run a Python script as a setuid
program? Yes, there is: you could create a custom interpreter
designed to run Python scripts that have their setuid bit enabled.
Your interpreter would need to be owned by root and be a setuid
program itself, and scripts intended to be run by it would start
with `#!/path/to/my/custom-interpreter`.

The custom interpreter would need to

a. inspect the script file it is being asked to run, and check whether
   it has the setuid bit enabled.
b. if not, then privileges should be dropped; otherwise, use `seteuid`
   to assume the privileges of the owner of the script.
c. use the `execve` system call (see `man execve`) to start the normal
   interpreter (e.g. `/usr/bin/python3`, for Python scripts) running,
   with the script supplied to it as an argument.

The custom interpreter would also need to be carefully coded to avoid
the possibility of
[injection attacks][injection-attacks] and a wide range of other
problems. Examples of custom interpreters which aim to do this
can be found [here][selliott] and [here][setuid-on-shell].
(Note: the safety of the code in these custom interpreters
has not been vetted â€“ use of it is at your own risk.)

[injection-attacks]: https://owasp.org/www-community/Injection_Theory

[selliott]: https://selliott.org/python/
[setuid-on-shell]: http://web.archive.org/web/20080703190734/https://www.tuxation.com/setuid-on-shell-scripts.html#primarycontent

Would a custom interpreter like this be a good idea? It's doubtful.
Programs like the Python interpreter are very large and complex, were
not designed
with running at elevated privileges in mind, and contain innumerable
places in their code where security vulnerabilities could lurk.

Programs written in C have the disadvantage of not being
memory-safe;[^mem-safe-system-prog]
but (if crafted carefully) they have the advantage that they can be kept extremely
small and simple,
with a very limited number of locations which need to be reviewed for
security issues.

[^mem-safe-system-prog]: A number of systems programming languages
  have been developed which have better memory safety than C -- for instance,
  [Cyclone][cyclone], [ATS][ats], and [Rust][rust]. As yet, however, none
  of them have completely supplanted the role of C and
  C<span style="font-family: monospace">++</span> in systems
  programming.\
  (If you have an interest in memory-safe systems programming
  languages, then this [blog post][cyclone-influence] by Jonathan Goodwin
  examining the influence of Cyclone on later languages,
  including Rust, may be of interest.)
