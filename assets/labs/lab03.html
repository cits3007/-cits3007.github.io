<p>It’s recommended you complete this lab in pairs, if possible, and
discuss your results with your partner.</p>
<h2 id="setuid">1. <code>setuid</code></h2>
<p><code>setuid</code> (“set user identity”) is an important security
mechanism on Unix operating systems. When a <code>setuid</code> program
is run, it assumes the privileges of the <em>owner of the executable
file</em> (for instance, <code>root</code>), rather than (as is usually
the case) the privileges of the user executing the command.</p>
<p>An example of a <em>non</em>-<code>setuid</code> program is
<code>less</code> (and most other programs you commonly run). Try
running the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -al /etc/sudoers
$ less /etc/sudoers</code></pre>
<p>The output of the <code>ls</code> command should look something like
this:</p>
<pre><code>-r--r----- 1 root root 798 Mar 16 15:22 /etc/sudoers</code></pre>
<div style="border: solid 2pt blue; background-color: hsla(241, 100%,50%, 0.1); padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt; margin-top: 1em;">
<p><strong>Output of <code>ls</code></strong></p>
<p>The <code>man ls</code> documentation unfortunately doesn’t fully
explain this listing format – see the documentation of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/What-information-is-listed.html">GNU
coreutils package</a> for a fuller explanation, or <a href="https://devconnected.com/linux-file-permissions-complete-guide/">this
guide</a> for a short tutorial.</p>
<p>In brief: the first group of 10 characters (starting with
“<code>-r</code>”) indicates who can access the file, and how they can
access it. Every file on a Unix-like system has associated with it a set
of <em>flags</em> (binary options), and the last 9 characters in that
group show what they are. The meaning of the characters is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first character isn’t a flag – it indicates the type of file.
A directory is shown as “<code>d</code>”, and a symbolic link as “l”.
Other file types are shown using other characters, as oulined in the GNU
coreutils documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>The remaining 9 characters should be read in groups of three. The
first group indicates permissions available to the file owner, the
second, permissions available to the file group, and the third,
permissions available to everyone else.</p>
<p>If someone has read, write and execute permissions, the group of
three will be the characters “<code>rwx</code>”’; if they only have a
subset of those permissions, some of the characters will be replaced by
a hyphen.</p>
<p>Thus, a file where the user has read, write and execute permissions,
but everyone else only has read permissions, will look like this:
<code>-rwxr--r--</code>.</p>
<p>For some programs, the “<code>x</code>” in the first group may be
replaced by “<code>s</code>”, as we shall see – this tells the operating
system that it has the “<code>setuid</code>” feature enabled, and when
run, its effective permissions are those of the <em>owner</em> of the
file (rather than of the user who started the process).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file specifies which users on the
system can temporarily acquire <code>root</code> privileges using the
<code>sudo</code> command. Only the <code>root</code> user can read the
file, so when you try to read it with <code>less</code>, you get a
permission error.</p>
<p>Obviously, programs that use features like <code>setuid</code> can be
very dangerous: if they are not carefully written, their elevated
privileges can have unexpected consequences. However, many programs
<em>do</em> need to run with special permissions. Consider the
<code>passwd</code> program, for instance, which allows a user to change
their password. Passwords on Unix systems are typically stored in a file
called <code>/etc/shadow</code>, which only the <code>root</code> user
can read or change. (Run <code>ls -al /etc/shadow</code> to see its
permissions – what are they?) When you successfully run the
<code>passwd</code> program, it updates the contents of
<code>/etc/shadow</code> with your new password (actually, a <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcshadow-file/">hashed
and salted</a> version of your password), despite the fact that the user
doesn’t have permissions to change that file. Run</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -al `which passwd`</code></pre>
<p>to see the permissions of the <code>passwd</code> executable. You
should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 68208 Mar 14 16:26 /usr/bin/passwd</code></pre>
<p>The “<code>s</code>” in the first 3 characters of the permissions
indicates that this program has the <code>setuid</code> feature
enabled.</p>
<h3 id="setuid-programs">1.1. <code>setuid</code> programs</h3>
<p>Consider the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;chsh&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>&quot;su&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>&quot;sudo&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>What do they do? (Read the <code>man</code> pages for the commands
for details.) How can you find out where the executable files for those
commands are located? (Hint: check out <code>man which</code>.) List the
permissions for the executables using <code>ls -al</code>. What do they
have in common? Why is it needed?</p>
<p>For each of these commands, copy the executable to your working
directory, and run <code>ls -al</code> on the copy. What permissions
does the copy have? Try running the copied <code>sudo</code> and
<code>chsh</code> commands (give <code>chsh</code> the password
<code>vagrant</code>, and suggest <code>/bin/sh</code> as a new shell).
What happens?</p>
<p>You can add the <code>setuid</code> feature to the copied programs by
running the command <code>chmod u+s ./SOME_PROGRAM</code> (inserting the
name of the copied program as appropriate). However, the programs will
still be owned by you – what happens if you try to run them?</p>
<h3 id="relinquishing-privileges">1.2. Relinquishing privileges</h3>
<p>When a program like <code>passwd</code> or <code>sudo</code> needs to
have the <code>setuid</code> feature enabled, it is best practice to use
the elevated privilege level for as short a time as possible. Once the
privileges have been used for whatever purpose they were needed for, the
program should relinquish them – it does so by calling the
<code>setuid()</code> function. (Read about the <code>setuid()</code>
function at <code>man 2 setuid</code>.)</p>
<p>This is especially important for long-running processes. For
instance, a web server might require higher permissions than normal
early in the life of the process (e.g. to read configuration files, or
listen for connections on port 80, which normally only <code>root</code>
can do) but should drop those permissions once they are no longer needed
– otherwise the potential exists for them to be exploited. Using as few
privileges as are needed, for as short a time as is needed, is known as
the “Principle of Least Privilege”: read more about it in the Unix
Secure Programming HOWTO on <a href="https://dwheeler.com/secure-programs/3.012/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/minimize-privileges.html">minimizing
privileges</a>.</p>
<p>However, the code needed to successfully relinquish privileges is not
as simple as one might hope. Read the Software Engineering Institute’s
<a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/POS37-C.+Ensure+that+privilege+relinquishment+is+successful">web
page on relinquishing permissions</a> for some of the issues.</p>
<p>Save the following program as <code>privileged.c</code> and compile
it. (Hint: a quick way to do so is to run
<code>make privileged.o privileged</code>, even if you have no Makefile
in your current directory. <code>make</code> contains builtin knowledge
of how to compile and link C programs.)</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

void main() {
  int fd;

  /* Assume that /etc/zzz is an important system file,
   * and it is owned by root with permission 0644.
   * Before running this program, you should create
   * the file /etc/zzz first. */
  fd = open(&quot;/etc/zzz&quot;, O_RDWR | O_APPEND);
  if (fd == -1) {
     printf(&quot;Cannot open /etc/zzz\n&quot;);
     exit(0);
  }

  /* Simulate the tasks conducted by the program */
  sleep(1);

  /* After the task, the root privileges are no longer needed,
     it&#39;s time to relinquish the root privileges permanently. */
  setuid(getuid());  /* getuid() returns the real uid */

  if (fork()) { /* In the parent process */
    close (fd);
    exit(0);
  } else { /* in the child process */
    /* Now, assume that the child process is compromised, malicious
       attackers have injected the following statements
       into this process */

    write (fd, &quot;Malicious Data\n&quot;, 15);
    close (fd);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Then create the file <code>/etc/zzz</code>, which we will assume is
an important system file:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo touch /etc/zzz
$ sudo chmod 0644 /etc/zzz</code></pre>
<p>What permissions does <code>/etc/zzz</code> have once you’ve done
this?</p>
<p>Run the <code>privileged</code> executable using your normal user
account, and describe what you have observed. Will the file
<code>/etc/zzz</code> be modified? Explain your observation.</p>
<p>Now change the owner of the <code>privileged</code> executable to
<code>root</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo chown root:root ./privileged</code></pre>
<p>Try running it again – what happens? Why?</p>
<p>Finally, enable the <code>setuid</code> feature:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo chmod u+s ./privileged</code></pre>
<p>Run the program again – is <code>/etc/zzz</code> modified?</p>
<h3 id="discussion-of-code">1.3. Discussion of code</h3>
<p>When programs are run which use the <code>setuid</code> feature,
there are multiple different sorts of “user ID” at play.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rUID</code> – the real user ID. This means the ID of the user
who created the process.</li>
<li><code>rGID</code> – the real group ID. This means the group ID of
the user who created the process.</li>
<li><code>eUID</code> – the effective user ID. For many executables,
this will be the same as the <code>rUID</code>. But if an executable has
the <code>setuid</code> feature enabled, then the <em>effective</em>
user ID will be different – it will be whoever owns the executable
(often, <code>root</code>).</li>
<li><code>eGID</code> – the effective group ID. This is similar to
<code>eUID</code>, but for user groups. Programs can have a
<code>setgid</code> feature enabled, and the effective group ID can be
different from the real group ID if it is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the code above, paste the following at various spots in the
program to see what the real and effective user ID are:</p>
<pre><code>  uid_t spot1_ruid = getuid();
  uid_t spot1_euid = geteuid();
  printf(&quot;at spot1: ruid is: %d\n&quot;, spot1_ruid);
  printf(&quot;at spot1: euid is: %d\n&quot;, spot1_euid);</code></pre>
<p>(Change <code>spot1</code> to <code>spot2</code>, <code>spot3</code>
etc. in the other locations you paste the code.) Re-compile the program,
give it appropriate permissions, and run it again – what do you
observe?</p>
<p>In the code above, there are a number of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The call to <code>setuid</code> made to drop privileges can
<em>fail</em>. (What does <code>man 2 setuid</code> say about the return
value of <code>setuid</code>?) If privileges can’t be dropped, usually
the only sensible thing to do is to abort execution of the
program.</p></li>
<li><p>A call to <code>fork</code> spawns a child process. The child
process inherits the real user ID, effective user ID, and all the open
files of the parent process. That being so, what do you think allows a
malicious user to exploit the child process in this case? How would you
fix it?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As an aside: it’s quite common for a program that needs special
privileges to “split itself into two” using the <code>fork</code> system
call. The parent process retains elevated privileges for as long as it
needs, and sets up a communications channel with the child (for
instance, using a <em>pipe</em>, a <em>socket</em> or <em>shared
memory</em> – more on these later). The parent process has very limited
responsibilities, for instance, writing to a <code>root</code>-owned
file as need, say. The child process handles all other responsibilities
(e.g. interacting with the user).</p>
<h2 id="capabilities">2. Capabilities</h2>
<p>Traditionally on Unix-like systems, running processes can be divided
into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>privileged</em> processes, which have an effective user ID of 0
(that is, <code>root</code>)</li>
<li><em>unprivileged</em> processes – all others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Privileged processes bypass any permission checks the kernel would
normally apply (i.e., when checking whether the process has permission
to open or write to a file), but unprivileged processes are subject to
full permission checking.</p>
<p>This is a very coarse-grained, “all or nothing” division, though.
Modern OSs may take a finer-grained approach, in which the ability to
bypass particular permission checks is divided up into units called
<em>capabilities</em>. For example, the ability to bypass file
permission checks when reading or writing a file could be one privilege;
the ability run a service on a port below 1024 might be another.</p>
<p>Since version 2.2 of the Linux kernel (released in 1999), Linux
posseses a capabilities system. It is documentated under <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html"><code>man capabilities</code></a>,
and <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/linux-capabilities-why-they-exist-and-how-they-work">this
article</a> provides a good introduction to why capabilities exist and
how they work.</p>
