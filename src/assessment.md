## About the unit assessments

### What are the assessment items, when are they due, and what are they worth?

The assessment for {{ siteinfo.unitcode }} consists of
an online quiz, a mid-semester take-home test, a project,
and a final examination:

::: { class="assessment-table-ctr" }

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
- {%- for header_item in siteinfo.assessment_table.header %}
  - {{ header_item }}
  {%- endfor %}
{%- for row in siteinfo.assessment_table.body %}
- {%- for el in row %}
  - {{ el }}
  {%- endfor %}
{%- endfor %}
```

:::


Assessments will normally be due at **5 pm**{ class="hi-pri" } on
<span title="Why Thursday? Because then if something goes wrong with
submission, there's still a weekday left to contact the UC and fix it." >**Thursdays**{ class="hi-pri" }</span>.
Any changes to this will be announced in the
[**{{help_forum}}**]({{forum_url}}){ class="hi-pri" target="_blank" }
help forum,
as well being noted on this website.

<!--

-->

**Do not**{ class="hi-pri" } rely on the [Unit Outline]({{outline_url}})
for exact
assessment due dates -- the software used to generate the unit outlines
is known to be buggy, and may insert incorrect due dates.
Instead, use the assessment dates published here (also available from
the [**Schedule**](schedule){ class="hi-pri" }).
Any changes will be published here, as well as being announced
on the unit [**discussion forum**]({{forum_url}}){ target="_blank" }.

<!--

Online quizzes, tests and exams **must**{ class="hi-pri" } be submitted by the
due date and time â€“ this will be enforced strictly (just as it is for
face-to-face tests and exams), and late submissions will receive a mark
of 0. It is your responsibility to ensure you submit by the due date and
time -- even if you think a website such as Moodle will not stop you
from making a late submission.

[No extensions are permitted](/faq#extensions){ class="hi-pri" }
for quizzes and tests: they must be
done on the dates specified (just as for face-to-face tests and exams).
For more details, see [**"Can I get an extension on the deadline for an
assessment?"**](/faq#extensions){ class="hi-pri" } in the unit FAQ.

Your submitted work or answers for any assessment item
[may be submitted](/faq#plagiarism-checks) to plagiarism detectors
such as `JPlag`, `moss` or `turnitin` to detect plagiarism.



### Common questions about assessments { #assessment-faqs # }

Several common questions about assessment are answered on the
unit [**FAQ**](/faq){ class="hi-pri" } (Frequently Asked Questions) page.

These include the following:

- [What material is examinable/testable?](/faq#examinable-material)
- [What are the expectations regarding citation of sources/academic
  conduct?](/faq#source-citation-conduct-expectations)<br>
  (In brief: abide by UWA's academic conduct policy; be careful not to
  plagiarize.) 
- [What is the marking rubric for assessments?](/faq#marking-rubric)
- [Are the quizzes/tests/exams open book?](/faq#test-conduct)


## Assessment item details


### Week 3 quiz

- This quiz will be available on {{ siteinfo.moodle }}.


<!--!
<details>
<summary>Quiz details (click to expand)</summary>
<div style="border: inset 5pt var(--accent-v-light); margin: 2em; padding: 1em; border-radius: 5pt;">
!-->


- Ensure you leave at least 1-2 hours available in which to complete it.
  If you wait until 2 hours before the due time, and
  don't complete it, you will be awarded 0 marks for incomplete
  questions.
- The quiz will need to
  be completed in one sitting, and students are allowed only one attempt
  at it. There is a time limit of 2 hours (though the quiz should take
  less than that).
- Once you've started the quiz, it's best not to leave your browser
  or computer unattended -- the quiz may time out, or the browser
  may refresh, and Moodle may record you as not having completed
  the quiz.
- The quiz is open-book; you can ***look at*** any book, website or
  software you like. However, the answers must be your own work (not that
  of anyone else) and in your own words, and you must not distribute your answers to other
  people.
- Ensure you have a good Internet connection when sitting the quiz -- you
  should sit it either on a UWA lab computer, or at home, but not using
  WiFi or a mobile device, as these could drop out part-way through.
- If you use a WiFi or mobile connection and it fails, you won't be
  given extra time to complete the quiz.
  If for some reason you can't access the quiz on {{ siteinfo.moodle }}, email me
  immediately from your University email account with a screenshot or
  photo showing the problem.
- Once you've finished the quiz, **take and keep** a
  **screenshot** of your completed attempt.
